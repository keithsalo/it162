<p class="days">April 4, 1968</p>

<p>Owing to an early spring, nightfall arrived a few minutes later each evening in Washington DC. The last bit of the sun’s warmth kept sixteen-year-old Kora Patterson company in the kitchen, reminding her of when she and her mama had cooked side by side.</p>
<p>Except that her mama had left them almost a year ago. Mrs. Patterson drove the VW bug into the garage, closed the automatic door behind her and kept the engine running until it and she died.  Back in California.</p>
<p>Kora splashed water on a head of lettuce. She pulled apart its soft green layers and laid them in the colander.  Wiping her hands on the cotton dishcloth, she then threw it over her shoulder.  She checked on the lasagna, her mother’s recipe. It needed to cook just a tad more.   When bubbly, it would be perfect.</p>	
<p>After dinner, she helped her ten-year-old brother Carl with homework.  He talked about his first day at a new school.  As she kissed him goodnight, she heard hammering.  What was her dad up to?  Walking into the den, she watched him balance on his office chair underneath the window.  The one that faced their sloping backyard, two stories below.  He held the quilt her mama had sewn for Carl.  An intricate red and white Irish star pattern.  Typical of him to grab whatever was at eye level.  Could he have chosen a more precious item? Or a ricketier chair for that matter? He held the comforter in his left hand, a hammer in his right, and three ten-penny nails in his teeth.</p>  
<p>“Daddy, what are you doing?” She tugged on one of the corners.</p> 
<p>Her daddy Roy grabbed it back, eyeing her. “It was in the linen closet, not on his bed.”</p>  
<p>“No one can see in that window from any direction.  Except maybe a circus giant on stilts.” </p>
	<p>“I needed something right away; they might be headed this way.”</p> 
	<p>“They who?”</p>
	<p>“Dr. King was assassinated earlier tonight. They’re tearing up the place.”</p>
    <p>“You’re wrong.  Can you please come down before you topple over?”</p>
	<p>“Wait a minute!  I’m not done.”</p>
	<p>“You’re ruining one of the few sentimental things Carl has from mama.”</p>
	<p>“If he cares so much about it, why wasn’t it on his bed?”</p>
	<p>“It’s not yours.”</p>
	<p>“Turn on the TV and see for yourself.”</p>
	<p>Her daddy refocused his efforts.  He pounded the hefty nails through the cloth and into the molding.</p>
	<p>Kora clenched her hands and walked into the living room. She flipped on the news to hear Walter Cronkite, CBS anchor, announce the breaking news.  With the teletype ticking in the background, he said, “Good evening. Dr. Martin Luther King, the apostle of non-violence in the civil rights movement has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.”</p>
	<p>Kora yelled, “This must be a mistake. Daddy?”</p>
	<p>“He only lived for an hour.”</p>
	<p>Her whole body trembled; she felt sick.   Kennedy gone, now King. And it had only been a year since their mother’s suicide.</p> 
	<p>“They’re looting on 14th,” her father said.</p>
	<p>Hearing the commotion, Carl came downstairs.  “What’s looting?”</p>
	<p>“Stealing things that don’t belong to you,” her dad said.  “Washing machines, TVs, anything you can carry.”</p>
	<p>“How do you carry a washing machine?” Carl asked and then noticed his quilt.  “Daddy, no.”</p>
	<p>“Find me something better then.”</p>  
	<p>“This isn’t World War II; we don’t need blackout curtains,” Kora chimed in.</p>
    <p>He finished the task, wheeled the chair back into position.  Without looking at his children, he flew down the stairs to the basement.  Kora heard him grunting as he lifted the garage door.  He backed the car in from the driveway.</p> 
	<p>Perched at the top of the stairs, she shook her head. “What was that for?”</p>
	<p>“If we have to leave quickly.”</p> 
	<p>Kora walked to Carl and put her arms around him. “Now you’re scaring him. I’m more worried about my friend’s family than ours. They live near 14th street.”</p>
	<p>“What friend?”</p>
	<p>“At school, Vivian, the one that helps me with geometry.”</p>
    <p>“Doesn’t ring a bell. But the Katz’s telephoned earlier, worried about their deli.  They told me to put our car out of sight, just in case.”   </p> 
	<p>“Carl, go back to bed,” Kora looked down at her brother. “It’ll be alright, don’t worry.”</p>
	<p>Upstairs in her bedroom, Kora tried to focus on her homework.  The news of King’s assassination sunk in as she lit candles stuffed in old chianti bottles.  She closed her eyes. He only wanted to make things better.  Why wasn’t that enough to keep someone alive?</p>
	<p>She found herself staring at the light, wondering where things had gone so wrong.  One bullet ended yet another life. They can’t kill freedom, someone on the news said.  Why did evil get to triumph? Why was it allowed the upper hand?  If only King had stood on that balcony ten minutes earlier, he’d still be alive. He must have had death threats before. Why wasn’t he more careful?</p> 
	<p>Her mama would be as sad as she felt.   She believed in Dr. King and felt devastated when JFK, the first Irish American president was killed, saying “I knew I hated Texas.”  Would she have survived this year?</p> 
	<p>In the last few months before her mama’s death, she read everything she could get her hands on about civil rights, the Indian movement and feminism. What was she looking for?   She mentioned to Kora how she felt she had missed the boat, that it was too late for to achieve the dreams she’d set aside to marry and have kids.  Kora remembered her checking out titles from the library like, “Why We Can’t Wait” by Dr. King and “Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee” by Dee Brown.</p>
	<p>Opening her geometry book, Kora sighed.  When would she ever need to use an isosceles triangle in real life? Who cared, especially tonight when it felt like the soul had fallen out of the world.   She slammed the book shut, shifted to tomorrow’s reading of three poems.  Harry’s mom wrote one of them.   She was going to teach poetry to their English class next Friday.</p>  
	<p>She tried to think if anyone she knew would have Viv’s phone number, but Kora had just moved to DC a few weeks ago and that day was their first at new schools. Not long enough.</p>
	<p>After the police found her mama last spring, slumped over the steering wheel, her daddy spent the first hour cleaning the refrigerator, tossing jars.  Odd, she thought but he said he needed something to do.   Kora focused on how to help Carl.  And what to do next while her dad occupied himself in the kitchen.  Shouldn’t they call relatives?  Plan a funeral? What do you do when your mama dies?</p>
	<p>Tonight, she watched her father again compelled to act. But covering the window? Convinced rioters were on their way?  It made as much sense as putting perfectly good food down the disposal.</p> 
	<p>Lying down, she tried to fall asleep.  She heard soothing King’s voice in her head. Had there been anyone else like him?  It felt like the first night her mama died all over again.  Maybe he wasn’t really dead, but her pillowcase felt damp as she turned off her reading light for the second time.</p>
	<p>Like a tumbleweed, it seemed like one thing rolled into the next. She needed to know if Viv was okay.</p>



<p class="days">April 2, 1968
Two days earlier</p>

<p>Only two days prior the Patterson’s had attended the 41st National Cherry Blossom festival.   No one knew yet that a world leader that preached non-violence would be gunned down in 48 hours.</p>  
<p>They strolled the loop trail that ringed the tidal basin and the Washington Mall.  Roy’s new colleagues on Capitol Hill said the cherry trees were the best welcome spring in DC had to offer. Take the kids, his boss Senator Murphy had said, Lincoln Memorial and the Smithsonian will always be there.</p>
<p>Three thousand cherry trees at peak bloom for four days only. Like a SALE at Lord and Taylor, the upscale department store.  All dressed up in their Sunday Best, except it was a regular Wednesday.  Her dad had picked them up from school.</p>
<p>Carl said the blossoms reminded him of pink cotton candy at the county fair back in California.  Their perfect beauty and gentleness would be gone in less than two weeks.  What else was so fleeting in life?</p>
<p>The windy afternoon threw the blossoms across the Tidal Basin, which looked like the rough gray skin of an elephant.  A pair of Lesser Scaup ducks, one with a scratchy voice, skidded across the middle of the basin and landed.  They left a wake behind them shaped like a triangle.</p>
<p>When they grabbed their seats for the ceremony, it began with the lighting of the stone lantern. The crowd grew quiet as they turned in their seats toward the four thousand pounds of carved granite, a gift from Japan in 1954.  Kora thought of the times she and her grandma had lit votives and prayed at St. Aloysius.  Candles imparted a peace; everyone felt it.</p>
<p>Dressed in a traditional kimono, the Japanese princess tried to light the lantern twice as the wind picked up.  She turned to the attendees, embarrassed.  Watching her, Kora thought of the mistakes she had made and felt less alone.  With her dad occupied with a new job on the hill, so many decisions fell to her in their new city. For one, choosing a school for Carl.  For her, classes, since they arrived just two months before the close of the school year.</p>  
<p>She took a breath and looked over to see what Carl was doing. He stood up, smiling to get a better view.</p>
<p>One of the speakers pointed out the dates for the annual festival were based on the blooming of the “indicator tree.”  When the one Yoshino Cherry tree on the mall first began to open, the others would follow in six to ten days. A tree that can predict the future, he said.  The audience laughed.</p>
<p>Kind of like Mrs. Robertson, Viv’s godmother, Kora thought.  Viv had mentioned her because she lived at the end of Kora’s block and had “special powers,” according to her new friend. Kora didn’t know yet what that meant.</p> 
<p>To close the ceremony, one of the officiants recited a poem written from the ninth century by a Japanese poet:</p>

<p>In these spring days,</p>
<p>when tranquil light encompasses</p>
<p>the four directions,</p>
<p>why do the blossoms scatter</p>
<p>with such uneasy hearts?</p>

<p>No one knew yet that Martin Luther King, Jr. would soon be gone forever.  But somehow everything, everything, felt fragile.</p>
