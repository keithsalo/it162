<p>Empty Bottles
 
 By Kate Stannard
  
 I open the door<br>
 to my grandma’s garage.<br>
 In the far corner,<br>
 spent Gallo wine bottles form a <br>
 small tidy mountain.<br>
 
 They dare each other to keep still,<br>
 never break, never split up forces.<br>
 Necks intact, 
 they each held half a gallon. <br>
 How long for just one to end up on the pile?<br>
 
 
 Stepping back, I close the door.<br>
 I don’t ask why during my visit, <br>
 and that’s just fine with everyone,<br> 
 by the way.<br>
  
 I won’t ask my Aunt Mavis about her volcano of glass <br>
 because she’s a good cook.<br>
 She feeds us roast beef with fat carrots,<br>
 reads us another chapter of In Cold Blood by Truman Capote.<br> 
  
 Or my cousin Sara because later she will take me<br>
 to the swimming hole off Delameter Road.<br>
 She drives now but I’m just thirteen.
 For her 16th birthday, 
 my aunt gives her a bottle of Irish whiskey,
 in honor of our people, she said. 
 It is not added to the pile.
  
 More empty bottles join the group before I leave on Sunday.
 Grandma knows my aunt was fired,
 and that her daughter’s mountain of glass now forms a pointy peak.
 She doesn’t open the door either.
 
 I will the blue-green pile to fall so I don’t have to wait anymore,
 wonder if it might wake me.
 When it explodes, like all ready volcanoes, it will start from the top.
 Stale wine will bleed on my grandma’s concrete that she bought on a teacher’s salary. 
 I’ll hose it for her, remove the stench,
 Maybe hot glass melted becomes a butterfly.
