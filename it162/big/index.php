    <p>I grew up in the Pacific Northwest and love to take advantage of the beautiful surroundings. </p>
    <p>I enjoy going on adventures with my partner up and down the coast as well as heading east over the Cascades. Once the pandemic is over our adventures will entail farther distances. </p>
    <p>This is my second quarter at SCC and I am enjoying the learning process with web development and excited to see where my education will take me!   </p>
