        <p>Shopping Carts 
Companies that want a website that allows users to purchase and update stock must have a type of eCommerce platform or solution to function successfully. Shopping cart software essentially allows users to build and maintain an online store.  Businesses can then add things like product information, images and pricing.<br>
ECommerce solutions have built-in extensions and templates for designers to use.  As the product is being sold the inventory numbers will be adjusted accordingly by the software. These types of software programs also offer the ability to manage large amounts of data rather quickly. 
There are two main types of software solutions when it comes to eCommerce site building: SaaS and open source. SaaS which stands for “Software as a Service” is a one stop shop that provides everything a business needs to have an operating online storefront for a monthly service fee.  They usually offer things like reliable hosting, security, site maintenance, web design tools, access to technical support and the shopping cart software itself. SaaS is suited best for clients that do not have as much technologic skills to build, host and update all the code necessary. Some of the top SaaS companies are Microsoft’s Azure, Shopify, and Service Monkey.<br> 
There are many benefits when it comes to SaaS companies but sometimes clients cannot afford them in their budget, especially newer businesses or clients capable of doing it themselves. Open source software is an excellent alternative which is a free downloadable program that offers everything needed to have a site up and running correctly.  It gives the user more control over customization but not having to rely on a company and their template. Also, there is no waiting time to change things on an open sourced site versus SaaS where you must talk to a customer support person in order to change something. Open source can be risky if you don’t know what you are doing.
